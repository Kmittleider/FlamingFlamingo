# FlamingFlamingo
An arcade game implementing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Our team chose to create an arcade game that involves a flamingo dodging fireballs which are cascading down from an erupting volcano. The fireballs will start falling slowly at the beginning and the longer the game continues, the faster the fireballs rain down. The speed increments to a faster pace every 10 seconds. A timer is implemented at the top of the screen to allow the player to keep track of how long they have survived for. 

The flamingo will have basic motions where it can only move from side to side using the left and right keyboard arrow keys. The flamingo will have three lives, once a fireball hits the flamingo, a life is deducted. However, there is hope! There are fish that fly down to help rejuvenate a life! But, only one fish falls for every 20 fireballs, so the player must stay vigilant. Extra lives can not be stored, if the flamingo already has three lives, a fish cannot grant any more. When all three lives have been lost, the game is over. A pop up message is displayed which informs the player how long they survived and that their flamingo sadly dies.
